COMMENT_7HN0CH5OAG,Alfred,"Apr 09, 2018 05:04AM","What language was this originally written in? Perhaps many of those names are spelled in completely different Japanese characters that somehow sound like ""K"" names anglicized. I don't know Japanese, but seem to hear quite often the common theme of translated best-selling Japanese novels not striking the same connection with English-reading audience. In this case, sounds like it's just the ending that docked it half star...And, oh, I like bento boxes. Your reviews are like bento boxes."
COMMENT_7HN0CH5OAG,carol.,"Apr 09, 2018 07:09AM","Alfred--thank you, as always!the writer writes in Japanese and his later books have the same translator, someone who majored in Japanese at Harvard, if I'm remembering right. It feels like a solid translation in that I was never conscious of something about the language not quite working, and yet felt a slight sense of cultural difference. I rather liked it and think I'll try another. I thought it worked better than Night Watch (I think that's the name; 'add book' isn't working atm). There's something that occurs that precipitates the type of ending which I'm slightly ambivalent about. I think that might be an especially cultural-focused element, but the steps that led to it seemed insufficient to me.Honestly, it's a problem in a few English books I read as well, but I suspect American thriller authors make it as simple as possible. :)"

COMMENT_RJTJ61DRGH,Carol,"Mar 28, 2017 08:29AM","HBalikov wrote: ""Should I start with this one, Carol? Which one did you read next?""yes, definitely. For the second, it depends on you. Salvation of a Saint offers you a known culprit, and a victim who had it coming. The mystery is how she pulled it off, and I considered it brilliant. Midsummer's Equation is a little quieter, and the relationship development between Galileo and a young boy is an unexpected bonus, given Galileo's personality and the genre, but the mystery/crime investigation and reveal is a little less perfect than Saint. Both were fascinating to me in terms of how the police approach resources and crime-solving, as opposed to the approach to which we Western readers are accustomed in an American or British police procedural. Does that help?"

The good news is that Higashino also doesn‚Äôt include personal details or focus on character development with his series characters.

I have free credit to use wish I could pick 2 right now because his writing is excellent. And in other reviews u state one of the reasons u enjoy the detetective series is there's no complicated backstories and relationships w coworkers used as fillers and THAT is something I get so sick of especially the"" colleague/ supervisor out to get him/her"" thread I'm so relieved to have a straightforward person just working a case.- thanks for the great reviews"

Rather, it engages you with the subtle, yet vividly distraught fears and dreams of human beings, and how that can turn anyone into someone they're supposedly incapable of being. Brilliant."

COMMENT_IQ203544RQ,Irene,"Nov 15, 2010 08:04AM","Hi, Alexander O.,""Stilted"" may have been the better word because the dialogue felt a bit formal as I initially read it. I will change ""clumsy"" to ""stilted,"" as the latter is a more apt description.I read a number of translated books, and English is my second language (Polish is the first), so I notice such anomalies. Truthfully, I always am impressed with the amount of time and work that is essential in translating a book from any language to English! If it were not for you and your colleagues, my access to the world's library would be limited.Minimal criticism...dynamite book!A pleasure to meet you."
COMMENT_IQ203544RQ,Alexander O.,"Nov 15, 2010 11:23AM","Hello again!And thanks for your insight--the opening to any book in translation from Japanese is rough, I think, for the reader if there's any attempt being made to reflect the formal nature that the language can sometimes have. The weirdness goes on until the characters establish a voice in your head, but I think you've hit on something I always thought was a necessary evil...and maybe it's not! I'll definitely give the dialogue in this book a look over with that in mind before moving onto similar projects in the future.Thanks, and a pleasure to meet you, too."

That's an interesting point of view... Gives a whole new perspective to the story... Most people I discussed it with however interpreted it as love. But then that's the beauty of literature.

But the reference could have been The Devotion of Suspect X. It's ambiguous.

COMMENT_A8YAMT7W5K,Arun,"Nov 03, 2015 03:15AM","This. Everything I felt while reading Devotion of Suspect X and Salvation of a Saint put into crisp words. Just the other day, I was reminiscing how with western mystery (particularly sherlock or poirot), the readers are kept away from the emotional aspect of the mystery and mystery alone takes precedence over everything else (although, this is more often the case with the Sherlock books than with Poirot). Thinking about them only highlighted how Keigo has combined and balanced the two elements (mystery and emotion) so fluently. Throughout the story, I was rooting for Ayane, wishing that Utsumi was wrong and convincing myself that the murder was accidental or Ikai had something to do with it, all the while perfectly knowing that this was all wishful thinking."
COMMENT_A8YAMT7W5K,Z1,"Dec 21, 2017 01:19PM","That is what some people call the 'Play God' strategy. Let the readers play 'God'. The readers know the murderer from the start and that creates a kind of suspense as the reader tries to figure out how the murder could have happened and how the detectives will ever figure it out.

COMMENT_J67PLCZVAC,Vivian,"Jan 31, 2019 11:15AM","He usually does not follow the classic pattern of announcing the murderer at the end of the book; instead, the ending is more about wrapping up the emotional fallout, or about an explanation of the crime that includes the history of how the murderer arrived at their crime.This is what I enjoy about Higashino's work. Of those I've read, this was the least favorite, but still satisfying. I think I prefer the Detective Galilleo work because his character was more flushed out, while this Detective Kaga work seemed to be less so. They both are focused on the psychological and sociological, but Gallileo's character is better integrated into the story."

In this one, it was the (view spoiler)[ connection between the two writers as having taught at the same school (hide spoiler)] and in the seaside story I read--don't have time to look up the title--(view spoiler)[ it was the environmentalists fighting the oil rig.

COMMENT_XHCVHQ7N2Y,Ms.pegasus,"Jul 14, 2017 10:43AM","Observant review. It's true that Higashino sacrifices character portraiture in favor of devious plotting. Still, I love his books. They seem to reflect so much about Japanese social attitudes. Example: Kaga wonders if Nonoguchi thinks he's an incompetent police investigator, based on his unsuccessful teaching career. Nevertheless, very nice review."
COMMENT_XHCVHQ7N2Y,Greg,"Mar 07, 2020 08:31AM","Oddly, I read ""Malice"" right after Murakami's monstrous ""IQ84"". It's just pure accident that both books deal with plagarism. Both are flawed. I really like ""Malice"" till the end when many characters are interviewed: it felt like the author didn't have a specific conclusion in mind."

The heart of the story isn't in unraveling of 'who have done it' but rather 'how they have done it' and putting certain dissatisfaction aside, I enjoyed this epic saga which also managed to exasperate me more than often. However, ironically, the novel‚Äôs meandering tendency is also its greatest strength, and I suppose that's clearest justification of its author‚Äôs literary skills. But if I could quickly mention it, I was terribly disgusted by the blatant sexism spread throughout the novel.

COMMENT_ROEU0RBB9T,Paramita,"Feb 24, 2018 10:09AM","Rohisa, bang on! Especially the last rape is totally redundant to the story line, that part left a sour taste. And I found the whole meandering course a bit too much, at some places it felt really contrived. Some of the character sketches too felt incomplete, in my honest opinion.And also, I found the misogynistic shade of the general society portrayed to be kind of fascinating. The narrative is truly unique and masterful. The way the author keeps you on your toes and addresses the vague theories forming at the back of your mind, is truly something I have never experienced before. This is my 5th Higashino read over the span of two weeks, to say I am hooked would be an understatement."

The reader being able to make his own deductions and conclusions, the interconnected character arcs, the multi-layered side plots, the diffused focus on multiple crimes being committed throughout the book (instead of just focusing on one) are all the selling points of the book.It is pretty evident to me that the main plot (the original crime) isn't as important as the journey undertaken the 3 main characters Ryo, Yuhiko and Sagasaki (and a few others).The book never gave me any reason to care for the original victim. Finding out the true motivations and perpetrators for the original crime was always at the back of my mind and I was fully invested in seeing how intuition, deduction, dedication, luck and sheer happenstance come together to stop these 2 incredibly smart and careful villains from committing any more evils."

The early part of the story was simply filled with self-praising comments from the main character. Also, since it was written in the first person perspective, it only felt fake and a bit aggravating (kind of how one feels when somebody else brags about themselves in front of us for hours and hours).The kidnapping part was quite short and a lot of time was spent by main character talking to the ""victim"". The banter itself was neither fun nor cute. It was merely used as a device to explain the kidnapping scheme to the reader. Then the sex came out of nowhere (which got explained in the ending and I was quite grateful for that).Overall, this was nothing like any of the earlier Higashino novels. Not sure how much of these issues were due to translation. But I felt that the story itself was quite weak, regardless of the translation."

Needless to say, I have enjoyed both their works and I found Keigo Higashino to be an awesome mix of Agatha Christie + Conan Doyle. When it comes to crime mystery books, I haven't found any other contemporary novelists as good as Keigo Higashino. I have hopes from Hans Olav Lahlum. I recently read his The Human Flies and found it reasonably good. I might read some of his other works too going forward.My other interest lies in science fiction where I have recently enjoyed reading Cixin Liu's translated works - The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest and Death's End. I hope he continues to write such good science fictions and that it gets translated into English. Other science fiction writes I have enjoyed reading are Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Robert A. Heinlein.Then, there is Aldous Huxley whose works I have quite enjoyed - can be very thought provoking whether you agree with his ideas or not."

COMMENT_RV0Z7O8LI7,carol.,"Aug 19, 2018 07:07PM","Shoot! I think so, but there is a subtlety to the interactions of Yukawa and the Inspector that wouldn't mean much. The Devotion of Suspect X is the first one in the series translated into English (according to GR, it's book #3), and Salvation of a Saint is the other (book #5). There's not significant changes in the character lives, or any sense of following their intimate lives, except something happens in Suspect X that impacts the relationship between the two men. They aren't really ""consecutive"" any more than Christie's Hercule Poirot books were, I think. Stuff happened with Captain Hastings and Poirot, but it wasn't earth-shattering."

COMMENT_PY9EZ1YO6V,Smitha,"Apr 30, 2016 09:51PM","The Devotion of Suspect X is good, so also Salvation of a Saint - both by the above author.The first Japanese book I remember liking is The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Murakami. But be prepared for lots of things that are not ordinary - the thing called as magical realism.Murakami is my favorite Jap author followed by Higashino."

COMMENT_PY9EZ1YO6V,Sarath,"Jan 10, 2018 09:41PM",I read Suspect X and Drishyam...I wouldn‚Äôt call it a direct inspiration. The idea of creating a false alibi is there..but that‚Äôs not the key. How they go about creating a false alibi is completely different in Suspect X Vs Drishyam.

COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,Carol,"Apr 08, 2022 02:17PM","Ugh. How disappointing. They‚Äôre being translated out of order so I‚Äôd have to check original pub dates to take a POV on whether it‚Äôs a Higashino inconsistency or Higashino talent-fade issue. I pre-ordered but haven‚Äôt read this one yet, but your points are always well-made, so ‚Ä¶. This is just sad."
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,Carol,"Apr 08, 2022 02:19PM","In the translation issue, I‚Äôve noticed that he doesn‚Äôt consistently work with any one translator. I almost think his US publisher is hiring on a one-off basis and the winner doesn‚Äôt have any contact with Higashino at all. But I‚Äôm not blaming them for his product. He owns that."
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,carol.,"Apr 08, 2022 03:45PM","I will be extremely interested in what you think, Carol. Some of his other mysteries were slow, to be certain, but this pacing was just... odd.

COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,Daniel,"Apr 09, 2022 06:45PM","I am wondering, are these played straight or is there a bit of comedy? I bounced off Suspect X once and never got back to it, but I do vaguely recall attempting to watch some of the TV series. That kind of fell flat for me too, and iirc there he was working with a woman police officer and it kind of came off like she was in a comedy and he wasn't."
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,carol.,"Apr 09, 2022 07:47PM","To me, they are very straight. The physicist is perhaps the only oddball element. The female police officer tends to be extremely by-the-book, I feel. Weird. I don't get any humor feel beyond the humor/irony of life type of thing. This was a tv series?? I could believe that these books wouldn't work for you."
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,Daniel,"Apr 09, 2022 08:17PM","Yeah, there was a Japanese TV series just called Galileo. More like 2 mini series compared to US TV, but I don't think the first season actually adapted any of the books, just used the characters. The second season was like 6 years later and did adapt one of the books. I think the same actors were in a theatrical movie for Suspect X.I think it was actually on netflix at some point, no idea if it still is.I honestly seem to have a more miss than hit ratio with Japanese crime novels. I do remember liking some of Miyuki Miyabe's crime thrillers ages ago, but there doesn't seem to be much available from her in translation now. (I did not care for her portal fantasy novel Brave Story.)"
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,carol.,"Apr 09, 2022 08:22PM","Ah, Daniel-san, way to lead me down the internet rabbit hole. First Miyuki, then on to another famous Japanese author... I'll stop now. But if you can think of any Japanese Agatha Christies, I'd be interested."
COMMENT_4E0UO7S4BH,Daniel,"Apr 09, 2022 08:58PM","I don't know of anything I can actually attest to the quality of, but Edogawa Rampo is regarded as the kind of granddaddy of Japanese mysteries and I think the other most famous one is Seishi Yokomizu famous for his Kosuke Kindaichi books. That reminds me of some stuff I own I need to put on the TBR."

COMMENT_CA98O3BDAU,Miles,"Jan 18, 2020 04:34PM","The speech about ""we all contribute to the future, not just the geniuses"" may feel a bit preachy ... but it's also arguably true, and is especially interesting in the context of this story, because this mirrors the behavior of the chaotic physical systems which form such a large part of the story: even in a deterministic universe (which is itself doubtful given quantum mechanics), certain types of physical system are very hard (read, almost impossible) to predict far into the future because the effect of very small changes can be magnified so greatly over time that they overwhelm seemingly more significant effects.It's indeed kinda ridiculous that Madoka and Kento have the ability to predict such systems, but if we assume ""magic,"" I think it's a neat followup for Madoka to apply this ability to human society to come up with the awesome last line of the book...[I didn't like the ending generally, but that last line was a kicker!]"
